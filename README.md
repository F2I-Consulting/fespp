## WINDOWS BINARIES
- Please download the windows binaries of Fespp in the [release section](https://github.com/F2I-Consulting/fespp/releases) and follow instructions of the README.txt contained in the zip.
- If you want to build Fespp by your own, look below for instructions.

## BUILD dependencies
- [Fesapi v2.0.0.0](https://github.com/F2I-Consulting/fesapi/releases/tag/v2.0.0.0)
- ParaView with same HDF5 libraries used by Fesapi
	 > known to work on Linux and Windows with ParaView 5.6.0

## BUILD & INSTALL Fespp
1. **CONFIGURE** Fespp with CMAKE
You should fill in the following variables
   * FESAPI_DIR:PATH=../install
A FindFesapi script will automatically use the above variable to set the FESAPI_INCLUDE and FESAPI_LIBRARY variables (visible in advanced mode)
   * ParaView_DIR:PATH=../PV5-6_Build/install/lib/cmake/paraview-5.6 (or, on windows, the cmake build directory of your built paraview from source)
   * If Qt has been built with ParaView, Qt5_DIR:PATH=../PV5-6_Build/install/lib/cmake/Qt5 else you should reference to your own Qt version (for example C:/Qt/Qt5.10.1/5.10.1/msvc2015_64/lib/cmake/Qt5)
2. **GENERATE** the build solution with CMAKE once the CONFIGURE step is OK
3. **BUILD** the solution generated by CMAKE
4. **COPY** the folllowing built libraries in the Paraview bin folder.
 
	- On Linux:
	   - <span>libFesapiCpp.so</span> (from Fesapi built)
	   - libFesapiCpp.so.2.0 (from Fesapi built)
	   - libFesapiCpp.so.2.0.0 (from Fesapi built)
	   - <span>libFespp.so</span> (from Fespp built)
   
	- on Windows:
	   -  FesapiCpp.2.0.0.0.dll (from Fesapi built)

## Execution
1. Only if you use MPI Paraview version, **Run** the **Paraview server** (Caution : use **MPI** build of ParaView!!!) : 
	> mpirun -np 8 ./pvserver
2. **Run** the **Paraview client** : 
	> ./paraview
3. Only if you use MPI Paraview version, **Connect** the **Client to** the **Server**
On client side : File->Connect...  and then fill in the required fields.
